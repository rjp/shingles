2203 - WICKET - Philander run out (Broad direct hit) 23 - SA 243-8 (48.3 overs)Nel biffs a single, Philander runs one down to third man as the game slips away from South Africa. Nel has a big swing, there's a hesitant single, Broad hits the stumps with his throw to the striker's end, and is Philander in? Third umpire says he's fractionally... OUT!
