1953 - WICKET - Gibbs b Patel 37 - SA 93-2 (15.4 overs)KP is back on the field, and his first act is to throw the ball to slow left-armer Samit Patel for our first taste of spin this innings. No sign of the third powerplay yet. Gibbs immediately steers him for a single, then Kallis cover-drives but can only find the cover sweeper. But then Patel makes the breakthrough as he tempts Gibbs into a false stroke and bowls him!
