2200 - SA 243-7 (48 overs)Flintoff returns to bowl the 48th (and presumably 50th) overs. Nel is nearly yorked as he backs away to leg - if he'd stayed still it would have been a wide, but it's a dot ball. Nel has a big slog, but it's an easy single to mid-on. Philander nudges a single off his pads, then Nel can't get the fourth or fifth balls away - again, he would have got a wide if he'd stood still! Only a single is possible from the last ball - 33 runs from 12 balls needed, with Nel on strike. Game over?
